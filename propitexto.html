            Husqvarna Motorcycles GmbH is a Swedish-origin Austrian company which designs, engineers, manufactures and distributes motocross, enduro, supermoto and street motorcycles. The company began producing motorcycles in 1903 at Huskvarna, Sweden, as a subsidiary
            of the Husqvarna armament firm.[1] Today, Husqvarna Motorcycles GmbH is owned by PIERER Mobility Group.[2]

        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>prior 1987</h3>
        <p>
            Husqvarna was founded near the town of
            <a href="nowhere">Huskvarna</a> in Sweden in 1689. The company started out as a maker of muskets, and the Husqvarna logo still depicts a gun sight viewed from the end of the barrel.[3] As with many motorcycle manufacturers, Husqvarna first
            began producing bicycles in the late 19th century. In 1903, they made the jump to motorcycle manufacturing. The first "Husky" motorcycles used imported engines, and it was not until 1918 that Husqvarna began producing machines built entirely
            in-house. Around that time they secured a contract with the Swedish Army, and also began entering cross-country and long-distance motorcycle races.[1] In 1920, Husqvarna established its own engine factory and the first engine to be designed
            was a 550 cc four-stroke 50-degree side-valve V-twin engine, similar to those made by companies like Harley-Davidson and Indian. Husqvarna competed in Grand Prix road racing in the 350cc and 500cc classes during the 1930s and was Sweden's
            largest motorcycle manufacturer by 1939. All of the racing bikes were based on a 50-degree V-twin prototype built by Folke Mannerstedt in 1931. The company team beat the Norton works team at the Swedish GP in 1931 with a 1–2 finish by Ragnar
            Sundqvist and Gunnar Kalén. This and the next year's success led to a full commitment to the GP tracks with Stanley Woods and Ernie Nott joining the Husqvarna riding team. That year, Nott finished third in the 350cc Junior TT and Woods ran
            out of gas eight miles before the finish of the Senior TT. In 1935, the company withdrew racing support, but new bikes were still produced and raced privately,[4] while the company focused on producing a new two-stroke, two-speed commuter
            bike.[1] That year, Woods won the Swedish GP (marking the fourth year in a row that a "Husky" had won) on a 500cc Husqvarna motorcycle that weighted 279 pounds (127 kilograms).[5] With the rise of motocross as a sport Husqvarna focused on
            producing light weight racing bikes. They adapted their lightweight single cylinder bike to racing and delivered the Silverpilen, meaning 'silver arrow' in Swedish. At 75 kg and designed for racing it gained widespread popularity. Sporting
            many innovations like telescoping front forks and hydraulic damped suspension it became an international success.[6] The 1959 motocross championship went to Rolf Tibblin and his 250 cc Husqvarna.[7] The 1960 world 500 cc motocross championship
            was won by Bill Nilsson on a four-stroke Husqvarna.[7] In the 1960s, their lightweight, two-stroke-engined off-road bikes helped make the once-dominant British four-stroke motorcycles obsolete. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Husqvarna was
            a dominant force in the motocross world, winning 14 motocross world championships in the 125 cc, 250 cc and 500 cc divisions, 24 enduro world championships and 11 Baja 1000 victories. 1983 saw Husqvarna innovate again with the introduction
            of a 500 cc bike that set new standards for competition four-strokes. It was lightweight, air-cooled, easy-handling and changed the future of off-road racing motorcycles.[6] It was the predecessor of the Husaberg brand.

            <h4>Recent developments</h4>
            <p>
                Recently, Husqvarna Motorcycles has been preparing its re-entry into the street motorcycle market. In 2014, the company presented prototypes of the newly developed 401 Vitpilen and 401 Svartpilen at the EICMA in Milan, Italy.[17] Production ready versions
                were shown in 2016.[18] Together with the 701 Vitpilen, which was first revealed in 2015,[19] these motorcycles became publicly available in 2018.[20] In 2017, Husqvarna Motorcycles introduced a new range of enduro motorcycles with a self-developed
                two-stroke fuel injection system (Transfer Port Injection - TPI).[21] The new fuel efficient, sensor-controlled technology conforms with the Euro 4 regulations for emission management.
